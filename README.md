## Frappe HR

Frappe HR has everything you need to drive excellence within the company. It's a complete HRMS solution with over 13 different modules right from Employee Management, Onboarding, Leaves, to Payroll, Taxation, and more!

## Motivation
When Frappe team started growing in terms of size, we needed an open-source HR and Payroll software. We didn't find any "true" open-source HR software out there and so decided to build one ourselves.
Initially, it was a set of modules within ERPNext but version 14 onwards, as the modules became more mature, Frappe HR was created as a separate product.

## Key Features

- **Employee Lifecycle**: From onboarding employees, managing promotions and transfers, all the way to documenting feedback with exit interviews, make life easier for employees throughout their life cycle.
- **Leave and Attendance**: Configure leave policies, pull regional holidays with a click, check-in and check-out with geolocation capturing, track leave balances and attendance with reports.
- **Expense Claims and Advances**: Manage employee advances, claim expenses, configure multi-level approval workflows, all this with seamless integration with ERPNext accounting.
- **Performance Management**: Track goals, align goals with key result areas (KRAs), enable employees to evaluate themselves, make managing appraisal cycles easy.
- **Payroll & Taxation**: Create salary structures, configure income tax slabs, run standard payroll, accommodate additional salaries and off cycle payments, view income breakup on salary slips and so much more.
- **Frappe HR Mobile App**: Apply for and approve leaves on the go, check-in and check-out, access employee profile right from the mobile app.


### Under the Hood

- [**Frappe Framework**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): A full-stack web application framework written in Python and Javascript. The framework provides a robust foundation for building web applications, including a database abstraction layer, user authentication, and a REST API.

- [**Frappe UI**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): A Vue-based UI library, to provide a modern user interface. The Frappe UI library provides a variety of components that can be used to build single-page applications on top of the Frappe Framework.
